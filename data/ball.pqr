REMARK   5 WARNING: PDB2PQR was unable to assign charges
REMARK   5          to the following atoms (omitted below):
REMARK   5              211 N in NH2 14

REMARK   5              213 HN2 in NH2 14
REMARK   5 This is usually due to the fact that this residue is not
REMARK   5 an amino acid or nucleic acid; or, there are no parameters
REMARK   5 available for the specific protonation state of this
REMARK   5 residue in the selected forcefield.
